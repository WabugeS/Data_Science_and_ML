# WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT
Introduction to Python Programming( Data Structures)
# Objective 
-To reproduce all labs covered in class
# Tools Used
-Jupiter Notebook on VS Code 
# Step-by-Step Process
-Introduction to Data science and Machine Learning.
- Definitaion of Key terms
- Introduction to Python programming
  # Data Structures
  - Assignment of variables
  - Datatypes
  - Creation of Lists: Ordered collection of items and are mutable or changeable. Created in a square brackets. 
  - Operation on lists(Append,Extend, insert, remove, pop, index, count, sort, reverse)
  - creation of Tuples: is a ordered collection of items that can not be changed or modified i.e imutable, and it's created in a paranthesis. It's immutable hence we can only perfom count and index
  - Creation of Dictionaries: Unordered collection key-value pairs item created in a curly brackets or with key word dict before a normal bracket.
  - Operations on dictionaries: Accessing the items in the dictionary and updating the dictionary.
# This week formed the solid foundation to data science through python programing. I learnt to assign variable and different types of data structures and specific operations on them. 
# string datatype must always be in inverted comas, either single or double
